# Design Patterns with Java

The objective of this repository is to show application examples of some of the main design patterns, using the Java programming language.

## Classification

- Creational Patterns: These patterns are related to the creation of objects. They help abstract the details of how objects are created and shield us from the specific complexities of object creation.

- Structural Patterns: These patterns are related to the composition of classes or objects to form larger structures. They help define how classes and objects relate to each other to form more complex structures.

- Behavioral Patterns: These patterns are related to communication and behavior between objects. They help define how objects interact with each other and how responsibilities are divided among them.
